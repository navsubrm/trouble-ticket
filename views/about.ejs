        <h2>Basic Introduction</h2>
      </header>
      <p>The Information Systems Team Trouble Ticket Tracker is a web based system to support trouble ticket entry and management.</p>
      <p>The system is comprised of three main sections:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Public New Ticket Entry Form</li>
        <li>Ticket Management</li>
        <li>Settings and DB Maintenance</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The three interfaces allow for tickets to be entered by non-users and IW division. Only approved users are able to manage status and issue resolution.
        Resolved tickets are retained in the Archived Ticket List for a minimum of 1 year after archive to ensure continuity between crews.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="New_Ticket_Submission" class="main-section">
      <header class="about-header">
        <h2>Public New Ticket Entry Form</h2>
      </header>
      <p>To enter a new ticket the visitor will enter the following information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1. Name should include enough detail for IW division personnel to contact you.</li>
        <li>2. Department</li>
        <li>3. Division should be the proper name of the division.</li>
        <li>4. Date the issue started should be the date that the issue was first discovered.</li>
        <li>
          5. Requested priority should be an honest request for assistance (<strong
            >Not all requests are immediate. Be judicious if you want to be taken seriously.</strong
          >).
          <ul>
            <li>Immediate: 12 Hours</li>
            <li>High Priority: 24 Hours</li>
            <li>Priority: 48-72 Hours</li>
            <li>Routine: 1 week</li>
            <li>Not Applicable: Ticket submitted for tracking and notification only.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          6. Detailed description should include an identification of the machine and system impacted by the issue. It should also contain a complete
          description of the problem with enough information to assist IW division in immediately responding to the issue. If IW division has to gather
          additional information to troubleshoot, it will delay restoration of asset.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you receive an error on submission, you should read the error warning and use the contact link to inform IW division of the issue so that it can be
        corrected.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="Active_Ticket_List" class="main-section">
      <header class="about-header">
        <h2>Ticket Management</h2>
      </header>

      <h3>Ticket Actions</h3>

      <p>
        Under the ticket actions menu, tickets can be sorted by status, department, or using the text search option in the header. The text search field will
        only compare whole strings, so care should be taken to minimize the input initially to return the most related tickets.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any of the ticket lists allow for the list to be exported via email to support NOSR and ISIC engagement in corrective actions. To export the list,
        select the export list button under the header and select "send email" to auto-generated an email containing appropriate addresses and ticket
        information.
      </p>

      <h3>Ticket List</h3>
      <p>
        The ticket list is used to manage status of tickets from submission until resolution. When viewing the ticket list, ITS' can update ticket status and
        add comments for team awareness and turnover. Tickets are in-progress when active troubleshooting is occurring. A ticket would be either Help Ticket
        Submitted or Awaiting reply when no further action can be taken without additional assistance. Once the ticket is completed, it should be marked
        complete for review by the ISSM and transition to the archive list.
      </p>

      <h3>Archive Ticket List</h3>
      <p>
        The Archived Ticket List is a list of all archived tickets that have not been cleared or are less than 24 months old. This allows time to recover
        tickets that were inadvertently archived or not correctly resolved before archive. This will also allow the alternate crew on two-crew submarines to get
        a good understanding of the previous crews network status at turnover.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="Archived_Ticket_List" class="main-section">
      <header class="about-header">
        <h2>Settings and DB Maintenance</h2>
      </header>

      <h3>Add User</h3>
      <p>
        The add user link allows current users to create additional accounts as necessary to manage trouble-ticket resolution. User accounts require a name,
        username, and password. The username must be between 5 and 15 characters. The password must have 2 uppercase, 2 lowercase, 2 special characters, and 2
        numbers.
      </p>
      <h3>Edit User</h3>
      <p>
        The update user link allows for the current signed in user to modify their own account information. Password change time requirements are not
        automatically enforced and must be managed by the IW team.
      </p>

      <h3>Delete User</h3>
      <p>
        Users can be deleted by selecting delete user from the settings menu. A list of all users will be populated. Select a user from the list to delete the
        account.
      </p>

      <h3>Clean Archive</h3>
      <p>
        To clear archived tickets, select the clear archive on the setting menu in the header. All archive records that have had an arhive status greater than
        24 months will be removed from the database. An alert will provide the exact number of tickets removed during the action.
